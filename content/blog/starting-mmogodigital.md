summary = "Starting MmogoDigital is the culmination of a promise I made to myself years ago, that at the age of 30 I would start working for myself. Since I made the promise, the next logical step was to gain as much experience as possible so as to be ready when the day came to start my own thing."

### Why Another Web Agency
It is true there are a lot of web agencies in Botswana, and when you add freelancers to the mix, its possible to say the market is
saturated. But I think you would agree with me that the saturation is in terms of volume, not quality.
<br><br>
It is with this idea that MmogoDigital was born, the fact that there lacks a digital agency that consistently delivers
great web products, and also gives businesses access to cutting edge digital technology. As an example, who would you call
today if you wanted a bot programmed for you? Or who would you turn to for an IoT application?
<br>
So my vision was to become that go to place, if you had a wild idea (and the budget), we would not rest until we helped you
realize it.
<br>
<br>
The other reason we started MmogoDigital was patriotic. We have watched as companies come from outside and build poor quality software,
with poor UX, and charge obscene amounts of money for it. And this is software that we are forced to use. The tax filing software comes to mind. But
beyond that, we see it everywhere, poorly designed software that we are forced to interact with. And we realized we have the skillsets to
do better, and therefore we should set up shop and be in a position to offer our services.
