Digital marketing is aimed at either getting customers online, or growing your brand recognition online.
It is a deliberate process, which hs to be measured with proper metrics from which tweaks can be made to each
campaign. There are several services we offer for this, most of them listed below.

### Email Marketing
Companies need to build an email list, at every chance collect emails from customers and potential customers. This allows the company to have an audience ready every time they have a promotion,
special offers, new products etc. We help companies achieve this, by setting out multiple points of collection for these emails,
whether it be on your website, apps or social media channels. From here, we help set out a proper email marketing strategy,
with newsletters, automated emails, email analytics etc.

### Search Engine Optimization
Being searchable on Google is important, it is part of a proper inbound marketing strategy. Companies compete for keyword searches on Google, if you are a pool installation company for example, you want
people who search for pool installers in your area to find you at the top of the search results, and getting to that point is
a deliberate process, which we will undertake for you. There are several parts to a proper SEO strategy, and there basically are no shortcuts, in fact Google penalizes all shortcuts. A proper SEO process has to be followed,
and we will use our expertise to set this out for your business.

minds.
