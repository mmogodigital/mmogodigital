The advent of big data has enabled companies to understand their customers better, to be able to build products better targeted at customers,
and to also tailor products per customer. For example, if a certain customer always buys a certain product from you, then its possible to suggest certain products
to that customer that go with the product they keep purchasing. The way to do this is we set up analytics for your site or app or newsletters, and
by monitoring what each customer does each time, we get to help you build a profile of that customer.

In time, we make it possible for you to query this data, you could for example get a list of your customers that bought a certain product, or webt to a certain page on your
site, or any other fine grained filters you want. From these lists, you can then tailor products or services to these customers.
