e-Commerce allows companies to increase their reach, to sell to customers who they normally wouldn't be able to. It is not possible
to build stores and offices in every place that customers are, and companies were forced to be strategic in picking out locations, favouring
places that are densely populated. With e-commerce, it is now possible to serve customers wherever they are, even if they are beyond our
borders. We have vast experience in this area, gained from years running [eButler](/case-study/ebutler).

### E-Commerce Store Development
We build e-commerce stores for our clients, either turnkey solutions or using open source
solutions. At the end of the day, its all about delivering the best solution. We
handle all aspects of the store development, from the store brand identity to the actual
store code.

### E-Commerce Consulting
Our consulting service is geared towards maximizing conversion rates and improving
sales for your e-commerce platform. There are a lot of important parts to a successful
e-commerce operation, and we help our customers make the best choices for their
specific cases.

### Cart Recovery
A lot of e-commerce stores have customers that put items in their shopping carts,
and then fail to make the actual purchase for different reasons. These are solid
leads, because most of the time these are people who actually want to purchase
from you, and if there are no measures in place to target such customers, a lot
of sales are missed out on.

### Email Lists
One of the most important assets of an ecommerce store is its email list. It is so important it can actually be sold when the company folds, for tidy amounts of money too. It is important for any ecommerce service to start building an email list as soon as possible.
With an email list, it is easier to sell to customers when you have new stock, promotions or special deals. We would help you set up ways to
get emails from prospective clients as well as your existing customers, and help you figure out ways to use the email list to your advantage.
