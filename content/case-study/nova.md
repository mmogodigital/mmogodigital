### The Client Brief
Nova is a student bursary web app, it connects students with companies that offer bursaries. This is a very important project, because
in South Africa, students are not sponsored by the government, rather they have to either self-sponsor, or get bursaries. A platform that
connects deserving students with companies willing to give out bursaries therefore is very critical.


### The Stack
We used Django for the website, to allow the client to add more content over time. A site like this needs to be kept up to date with new bursaries and new companies for it to be useful.

### Design
The client likes the color green, and also wanted a clean and simple design. We cerainly delivered, and we made sure to keep the site simple and have the content drive the design, not the other way around. The choice of fonts was important, to make sure the content would be clear and legible.
