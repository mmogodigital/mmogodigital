### The Client Brief
Nova is a student bursary web app, it connects students with companies that offer bursaries. The project is the brainchild of Name Here, and she asked us to help her bring this project to life.


### The Stack
We used Django for the website, to allow the client to add more content over time. A site like this needs to be kept up to date with new bursaries and new companies for it to be useful.

### Design
The client likes the color green, and also wanted a clean and simple design. We think we delivered, and we made sure to keep the site simple and have the content drive the design, not the other way around. The choice of fonts was important, to make sure the content would be clear and legible.
