### The Client Brief
Benjamin & Davis had to redesign Giscoe’s website as part of their digital marketing plans, and needed a tech partner to execute on their designs with a 4 weeks turnaround time before launch. The new website was going to be slick, mobile and clearly showcased Giscoe’s services with a clear call to action.

### The Approach
Using Scrum for Software development, our Senior Engineers and a Project Manager working alongside the client’s Graphic Design and Digital Marketing team, we were able to deliver the project on time without issues.

### The Stack
The client wanted to be able to update the site content on their own, so we used our tried and trusted Django. It was a tough project, due to tight deadlines, and the client being particular about what they wanted, and the fact that the designers also had exacting standards that we had to adhere to. It was fun, being challenged like that and finding out just how much we can offer to our clients.

### Design
For this project, we were implementing a design that had already been created for us by the design firm Benjamin & Davis, and all we had to do was code it in a CMS and make sure the final site was the same as the provided PSDs. We loved the design, its simplicity, the big and bold typography, and above all else the minimalism. You will notice the site doesn't depend on big images to look good, there is a clever use of typography and color to deliver a great design.
