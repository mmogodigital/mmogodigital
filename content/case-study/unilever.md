### The Client Brief
Unilever SA needed to recreate their physical staff kiosks online to allow a “click & collect” process for their employees across all their offices from Durban to Johannesburg. The online store needed to address several issues such as stock availability, data privacy & security, payment, product quantity restrictions and integration with their existing SAP & Microsoft systems.

### The Approach
Through a deeper analysis of the challenges presented by the client, and observing employees using the kiosks live, we set out to create an omnichannel eCommerce platform that does not only allow the convenience of shopping on the go, but seamlessly integrates with the physical kiosks inventory & Point of Sale systems for real time transactions.
<br><br>
The reason behind this approach was to ensure that the online store works in the similar way as the kiosks without discrepancies that might render the new platform inconvenient, whilst allowing Unilever’s product marketing team personalise promotions based on cart history and behaviour on the platform using the built in CRM we added to platform.
