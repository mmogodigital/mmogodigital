### The Client Brief
Praekelt Consulting had to redesign Telkom’s website and integrate all the microsites they previously had. To effectively achieve the new design, they needed a dedicated Content Curation team to help with Telkom’s vast products and deals on a daily basis.

### The Approach
Understanding the requirements and the time sensitivity of the project, we deployed a full time team to work with Praekelt Consulting and Telkom’s product managers from the project planning phase till post launch of what is arguably the biggest & best Telecom eCommerce site in Africa. Our Content team remained with the project post launch to facilitate products and deals updates as per marketing and promotions plans of Telkom.

### Design
For this project, our work was limited to just the content. Telkom has a very complicated CMS, and has lots of products and deals that change quickly
