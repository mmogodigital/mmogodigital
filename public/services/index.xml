&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bots have become mainstream now, and we want to help companies take advantage of this new communication medium. Bots are
an extension of your company, they literally speak to your customers on your behalf. The bot is programmed to handle common requests and questions from
your customers, and to handle these on your behalf, and therefore lessen the load on your customer support representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;facebook-messenger-bots&#34;&gt;Facebook Messenger Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is ubiquitous, and Facebook bots would allow your company to go where your customers already are. For example,
a Facebook messenger bot can be programmed to show your customers a list of your services, the prices etc etc. For a newspaper,
it could display a list of news articles, or for a cinema a list of movies that is currently showing. This happens entirely within Messenger, and your customers
don&amp;rsquo;t have to call or inbox your Facebook page for this sort of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-bots&#34;&gt;Twitter Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter bots help your company interact with Twitter automatically, this is especially good for companies that
need to leverage Twitter a lot. The bot can be programmed to do a number of different tasks, like replying automaticaly very time your
company is mentioned on Twitter, following users, sending out promotional tweets etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slack-bots&#34;&gt;Slack Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a communication tool for companies, it lets company employees chat, share documents and work together remotely. We have been using Slack internally with our Johannesburg office to
work together on projects even though we are not in the same location. Slack bots accomplish a number of tasks, and
are limited only by your imagination. Slack bots add more functionality to Slack itself, to allow you to use Slack better and to have it
suit your company better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Content Management</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/services/content-management/</link>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more important than content for a website, or any digital product in general. Content is what drives websites and apps,
and properly crafted content connects more with customers. Content must be well thought out, keeping in mind what the goals
are, and also the tone of the content must conform to the overall brand strategy. Therefore our approach seeks first to establish all
these factors beforehand, then come up with a content plan.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Properly written content makes all the difference, even something seemingly as basic as what words to use on buttons on the
website or app make a huge difference in whether people do click on the button or not. We use our experience to drive the content
on the site to be effective as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-strategy-development&#34;&gt;Content Strategy Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each company has different content needs, and we want to pinpoint those exact needs through a series of discovery meetings. From
this, we come up with what sort of content the company has to put out, the regularity, the tone etc. We also have copywriters, and
therefore can write the content for the client based on the content plan we have agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-marketing&#34;&gt;Content Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the content has been created, it needs to be delivered and made discoverable to customers and potential customers. It can either
be shared via social media platforms, shared with other websites that have an audience your business needs, or emailed out to customers.
We can automate all these, and help you decide which mediums and platforms best suit each piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Analytics</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/services/data-analytics/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-4.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of big data has enabled companies to understand their customers better, to be able to build products better targeted at customers,
and to also tailor products per customer. For example, if a certain customer always buys a certain product from you, then its possible to suggest certain products
to that customer that go with the product they keep purchasing. The way to do this is we set up analytics for your site or app or newsletters, and
by monitoring what each customer does each time, we get to help you build a profile of that customer.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In time, we make it possible for you to query this data, you could for example get a list of your customers that bought a certain product, or webt to a certain page on your
site, or any other fine grained filters you want. From these lists, you can then tailor products or services to these customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;consumer-data-analytics&#34;&gt;Consumer Data Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, consumer data analytics helps your business use data gathered on your customers&amp;rsquo; behaviour to be used
to make decisions, by allowing you to segment your different customers, and to be able to make accurate predictions on
what they might like for example. Our service offering helps you gather the data from your digital channels, and then
to make sense of it, from which you can then make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;brand-analytics&#34;&gt;Brand Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brand analytics help you understand how your brand stands with your customers, with regard to your digital platforms. We help you measure how
well you connect with customers, by setting up measurements for key metrics that indicate how people view your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital marketing is aimed at either getting customers online, or growing your brand recognition online.
It is a deliberate process, which hs to be measured with proper metrics from which tweaks can be made to each
campaign. There are several services we offer for this, most of them listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-marketing&#34;&gt;Email Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need to build an email list, at every chance collect emails from customers and potential customers. This allows the company to have an audience ready every time they have a promotion,
special offers, new products etc. We help companies achieve this, by setting out multiple points of collection for these emails,
whether it be on your website, apps or social media channels. From here, we help set out a proper email marketing strategy,
with newsletters, automated emails, email analytics etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-engine-optimization&#34;&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being searchable on Google is important, it is part of a proper inbound marketing strategy. Companies compete for keyword searches on Google, if you are a pool installation company for example, you want
people who search for pool installers in your area to find you at the top of the search results, and getting to that point is
a deliberate process, which we will undertake for you. There are several parts to a proper SEO strategy, and there basically are no shortcuts, in fact Google penalizes all shortcuts. A proper SEO process has to be followed,
and we will use our expertise to set this out for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-marketing&#34;&gt;Social Media Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media usage in Botswana has grown very quickly over the last few years, and marketing properly on these platforms is essential for e=any company.
The idea is not to do a simple Facebook post or a simple tweet, it has to be a deliberate process so your message stands out in the noise. There are several factors that are important
for a successful social media marketing strategy. The tone has to match the audience, the time the post is sent out is important, the day of the week etc etc. The posts have to be relevant, leveraging current events for example, and stick in people&amp;rsquo;s
minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;influencer-marketing&#34;&gt;Influencer Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look for influential people, and have them push out targeted social media tweets to help you sell or be found on the
web. Celebrities have a lot of followers on social media, and we want to bring this audience to your company. With the right social media post, your company can have a sudden influx of users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Strategy</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/services/digital-strategy/</link>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly said nowadays that every company is a technology company, in that every company needs to leverage
technology to be competitive and remain relevant in its particular market. Companies that fail to do this lose out
to their competitors who leverage technology. With the advent of globalism, companies now have competitors from all
over the world, some of which are indeed technology first. We want to help local companies become technology first. Think
of us as your CTO (Chief Technology Officer). At the most basic level, we want to come in and look at your processes
and figure out a way to make them better with technology. There is a common joke within the tech industry, if you ever find yourself using an Excel spreadsheet, there is probably an app that performs the task better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-analysis-consulting&#34;&gt;Business Analysis &amp;amp; Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enable companies to understand user needs, embrace new technology and get innovative products and services to market faster. We create real products and deliver measurable results. Whether companies need to reorganize talent, resources and infrastructure or build them from the ground up, our team provides pragmatic digital and operational support throughout the strategy’s implementation and execution.facilitating a series of workshops to identify opportunities, generate and prioritize ideas, and prototype and test product and service concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ux-design-sprints&#34;&gt;UX &amp;amp; Design Sprints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design sprints are a practise popularised by engineers at Google, which they found gets the best results in putting out great products.
We undertake the same practise with our clients, to make sure we get great results. This is a great idea for
existing products, for example a website revamp, or a product that needs improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technical-consulting&#34;&gt;Technical Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with clients to ensure they have the right technical infrastructure in place, which includes systems, technology, people, skillsets and processes. We work with clients to help form partnerships or relationships with key technology vendors. To facilitate this, we can often leverage existing relationships from leading technology companies to provide unique access and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-product-innovation&#34;&gt;Business &amp;amp; Product Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with clients to identify business opportunities, and design the products and services to meet them. We take ideas beyond concepts, using rapid prototyping, testing and iteration. This approach facilitates a connection between strategy and execution, shaped by user research, market insights and client capabilities. We collaborate with clients to build the internal capabilities required to bring a new experience to market and sustain them after introduction. Our approach surfaces development opportunities by contrasting current and required people, organization, processes, systems and technology capabilities.We identify and unlock new sources of revenue related to existing and future digital assets. Our business strategists collaborate with clients to identify underlying business opportunities (e.g., new services, captive audiences, data) and determine an optimal mix of revenue models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-Commerce</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/services/e-commerce/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-Commerce allows companies to increase their reach, to sell to customers who they normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to. It is not possible
to build stores and offices in every place that customers are, and companies were forced to be strategic in picking out locations, favouring
places that are densely populated. With e-commerce, it is now possible to serve customers wherever they are, even if they are beyond our
borders. We have vast experience in this area, gained from years running &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/case-study/ebutler&#34;&gt;eButler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;e-commerce-store-development&#34;&gt;E-Commerce Store Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build e-commerce stores for our clients, either turnkey solutions or using open source
solutions. At the end of the day, its all about delivering the best solution. We
handle all aspects of the store development, from the store brand identity to the actual
store code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;e-commerce-consulting&#34;&gt;E-Commerce Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our consulting service is geared towards maximizing conversion rates and improving
sales for your e-commerce platform. There are a lot of important parts to a successful
e-commerce operation, and we help our customers make the best choices for their
specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cart-recovery&#34;&gt;Cart Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of e-commerce stores have customers that put items in their shopping carts,
and then fail to make the actual purchase for different reasons. These are solid
leads, because most of the time these are people who actually want to purchase
from you, and if there are no measures in place to target such customers, a lot
of sales are missed out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-lists&#34;&gt;Email Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important assets of an ecommerce store is its email list. It is so important it can actually be sold when the company folds, for tidy amounts of money too. It is important for any ecommerce service to start building an email list as soon as possible.
With an email list, it is easier to sell to customers when you have new stock, promotions or special deals. We would help you set up ways to
get emails from prospective clients as well as your existing customers, and help you figure out ways to use the email list to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach is simple, we want first to understand your business and what it does, then understand your goals and plans,
and from there we would be able to decide how to best approach your specific case. We believe all companies are unique
and also have unique needs, and therefore the solutions we deliver must be tailored to each company. We think of ourselves
as delivering digital solutions, and there is no way to deliver a solution if we don&amp;rsquo;t discover what problems you are
trying to solve, or what goals you aim to achieve.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Below is a list of the solutions we offer under web and mobile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;websites&#34;&gt;Websites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A website, at its most basic is a web presence for your company, a way for people to be able to find information about
your company on the web. However, we take a different approach, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to build websites just so you can be on
the web, we want to help you push your business goals with your website, whatever the goals may be. Do you
want more customers, then we have to create a website geared towards this. Do you want to sell directly to your
customers on your website, then the website must have your products taking centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intranets&#34;&gt;Intranets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intranet is an internal web app that you will use internally with your teams to communicate, share work, schedule meetings,
share resources etc. Because every company has unique processes and policies, we set out to create an intranet that conforms
to all these needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mobile-apps&#34;&gt;Mobile Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of users now have moved to mobile, mobile phone use in Botswana is very high, and companies need to go where the users are.
While websites are usable on mobile devices, a mobile app has the advantage of being tailored to the medium, and therefore it
delivers a better overall experience. We build apps for any use case, whether its for internal use in a company, or to be used
by customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ussd-apps&#34;&gt;USSD Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSD apps are very useful for companies that have a lot of customers without smartphones, and still need to deliver mobile
experiences. We create USSD apps that fulfill your specific business case, so that none of your customers are left behind. We
would handle API integrations with the major telecoms operators and deliver a USSD app to your specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
