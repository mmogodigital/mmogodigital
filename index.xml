&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bots have become mainstream now, and we want to help companies take advantage of this new communication medium. Bots are
an extension of your company, they literally speak to your customers on your behalf. The bot is programmed to handle common requests and questions from
your customers, and to handle these on your behalf, and therefore lessen the load on your customer support representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;facebook-messenger-bots&#34;&gt;Facebook Messenger Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is ubiquitous, and Facebook bots would allow your company to go where your customers already are. For example,
a Facebook messenger bot can be programmed to show your customers a list of your services, the prices etc etc. For a newspaper,
it could display a list of news articles, or for a cinema a list of movies that is currently showing. This happens entirely within Messenger, and your customers
don&amp;rsquo;t have to call or inbox your Facebook page for this sort of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-bots&#34;&gt;Twitter Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter bots help your company interact with Twitter automatically, this is especially good for companies that
need to leverage Twitter a lot. The bot can be programmed to do a number of different tasks, like replying automaticaly very time your
company is mentioned on Twitter, following users, sending out promotional tweets etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slack-bots&#34;&gt;Slack Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a communication tool for companies, it lets company employees chat, share documents and work together remotely. We have been using Slack internally with our Johannesburg office to
work together on projects even though we are not in the same location. Slack bots accomplish a number of tasks, and
are limited only by your imagination. Slack bots add more functionality to Slack itself, to allow you to use Slack better and to have it
suit your company better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Content Management</title>

&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more important than content for a website, or any digital product in general. Content is what drives websites and apps,
and properly crafted content connects more with customers. Content must be well thought out, keeping in mind what the goals
are, and also the tone of the content must conform to the overall brand strategy. Therefore our approach seeks first to establish all
these factors beforehand, then come up with a content plan.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Properly written content makes all the difference, even something seemingly as basic as what words to use on buttons on the
website or app make a huge difference in whether people do click on the button or not. We use our experience to drive the content
on the site to be effective as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-strategy-development&#34;&gt;Content Strategy Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each company has different content needs, and we want to pinpoint those exact needs through a series of discovery meetings. From
this, we come up with what sort of content the company has to put out, the regularity, the tone etc. We also have copywriters, and
therefore can write the content for the client based on the content plan we have agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-marketing&#34;&gt;Content Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the content has been created, it needs to be delivered and made discoverable to customers and potential customers. It can either
be shared via social media platforms, shared with other websites that have an audience your business needs, or emailed out to customers.
We can automate all these, and help you decide which mediums and platforms best suit each piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Analytics</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/services/data-analytics/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-4.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of big data has enabled companies to understand their customers better, to be able to build products better targeted at customers,
and to also tailor products per customer. For example, if a certain customer always buys a certain product from you, then its possible to suggest certain products
to that customer that go with the product they keep purchasing. The way to do this is we set up analytics for your site or app or newsletters, and
by monitoring what each customer does each time, we get to help you build a profile of that customer.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In time, we make it possible for you to query this data, you could for example get a list of your customers that bought a certain product, or webt to a certain page on your
site, or any other fine grained filters you want. From these lists, you can then tailor products or services to these customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;consumer-data-analytics&#34;&gt;Consumer Data Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, consumer data analytics helps your business use data gathered on your customers&amp;rsquo; behaviour to be used
to make decisions, by allowing you to segment your different customers, and to be able to make accurate predictions on
what they might like for example. Our service offering helps you gather the data from your digital channels, and then
to make sense of it, from which you can then make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;brand-analytics&#34;&gt;Brand Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brand analytics help you understand how your brand stands with your customers, with regard to your digital platforms. We help you measure how
well you connect with customers, by setting up measurements for key metrics that indicate how people view your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital marketing is aimed at either getting customers online, or growing your brand recognition online.
It is a deliberate process, which hs to be measured with proper metrics from which tweaks can be made to each
campaign. There are several services we offer for this, most of them listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-marketing&#34;&gt;Email Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need to build an email list, at every chance collect emails from customers and potential customers. This allows the company to have an audience ready every time they have a promotion,
special offers, new products etc. We help companies achieve this, by setting out multiple points of collection for these emails,
whether it be on your website, apps or social media channels. From here, we help set out a proper email marketing strategy,
with newsletters, automated emails, email analytics etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-engine-optimization&#34;&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being searchable on Google is important, it is part of a proper inbound marketing strategy. Companies compete for keyword searches on Google, if you are a pool installation company for example, you want
people who search for pool installers in your area to find you at the top of the search results, and getting to that point is
a deliberate process, which we will undertake for you. There are several parts to a proper SEO strategy, and there basically are no shortcuts, in fact Google penalizes all shortcuts. A proper SEO process has to be followed,
and we will use our expertise to set this out for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-marketing&#34;&gt;Social Media Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media usage in Botswana has grown very quickly over the last few years, and marketing properly on these platforms is essential for e=any company.
The idea is not to do a simple Facebook post or a simple tweet, it has to be a deliberate process so your message stands out in the noise. There are several factors that are important
for a successful social media marketing strategy. The tone has to match the audience, the time the post is sent out is important, the day of the week etc etc. The posts have to be relevant, leveraging current events for example, and stick in people&amp;rsquo;s
minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;influencer-marketing&#34;&gt;Influencer Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look for influential people, and have them push out targeted social media tweets to help you sell or be found on the
web. Celebrities have a lot of followers on social media, and we want to bring this audience to your company. With the right social media post, your company can have a sudden influx of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly said nowadays that every company is a technology company, in that every company needs to leverage
technology to be competitive and remain relevant in its particular market. Companies that fail to do this lose out
to their competitors who leverage technology. With the advent of globalism, companies now have competitors from all
over the world, some of which are indeed technology first. We want to help local companies become technology first. Think
of us as your CTO (Chief Technology Officer). At the most basic level, we want to come in and look at your processes
and figure out a way to make them better with technology. There is a common joke within the tech industry, if you ever find yourself using an Excel spreadsheet, there is probably an app that performs the task better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-analysis-consulting&#34;&gt;Business Analysis &amp;amp; Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enable companies to understand user needs, embrace new technology and get innovative products and services to market faster. We create real products and deliver measurable results. Whether companies need to reorganize talent, resources and infrastructure or build them from the ground up, our team provides pragmatic digital and operational support throughout the strategy’s implementation and execution.facilitating a series of workshops to identify opportunities, generate and prioritize ideas, and prototype and test product and service concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ux-design-sprints&#34;&gt;UX &amp;amp; Design Sprints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design sprints are a practise popularised by engineers at Google, which they found gets the best results in putting out great products.
We undertake the same practise with our clients, to make sure we get great results. This is a great idea for
existing products, for example a website revamp, or a product that needs improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technical-consulting&#34;&gt;Technical Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with clients to ensure they have the right technical infrastructure in place, which includes systems, technology, people, skillsets and processes. We work with clients to help form partnerships or relationships with key technology vendors. To facilitate this, we can often leverage existing relationships from leading technology companies to provide unique access and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-product-innovation&#34;&gt;Business &amp;amp; Product Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with clients to identify business opportunities, and design the products and services to meet them. We take ideas beyond concepts, using rapid prototyping, testing and iteration. This approach facilitates a connection between strategy and execution, shaped by user research, market insights and client capabilities. We collaborate with clients to build the internal capabilities required to bring a new experience to market and sustain them after introduction. Our approach surfaces development opportunities by contrasting current and required people, organization, processes, systems and technology capabilities.We identify and unlock new sources of revenue related to existing and future digital assets. Our business strategists collaborate with clients to identify underlying business opportunities (e.g., new services, captive audiences, data) and determine an optimal mix of revenue models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-Commerce allows companies to increase their reach, to sell to customers who they normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to. It is not possible
to build stores and offices in every place that customers are, and companies were forced to be strategic in picking out locations, favouring
places that are densely populated. With e-commerce, it is now possible to serve customers wherever they are, even if they are beyond our
borders. We have vast experience in this area, gained from years running &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/case-study/ebutler&#34;&gt;eButler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;e-commerce-store-development&#34;&gt;E-Commerce Store Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build e-commerce stores for our clients, either turnkey solutions or using open source
solutions. At the end of the day, its all about delivering the best solution. We
handle all aspects of the store development, from the store brand identity to the actual
store code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;e-commerce-consulting&#34;&gt;E-Commerce Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our consulting service is geared towards maximizing conversion rates and improving
sales for your e-commerce platform. There are a lot of important parts to a successful
e-commerce operation, and we help our customers make the best choices for their
specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cart-recovery&#34;&gt;Cart Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of e-commerce stores have customers that put items in their shopping carts,
and then fail to make the actual purchase for different reasons. These are solid
leads, because most of the time these are people who actually want to purchase
from you, and if there are no measures in place to target such customers, a lot
of sales are missed out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-lists&#34;&gt;Email Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important assets of an ecommerce store is its email list. It is so important it can actually be sold when the company folds, for tidy amounts of money too. It is important for any ecommerce service to start building an email list as soon as possible.
With an email list, it is easier to sell to customers when you have new stock, promotions or special deals. We would help you set up ways to
get emails from prospective clients as well as your existing customers, and help you figure out ways to use the email list to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;service-img&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/banners/banner-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Web and Mobile&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach is simple, we want first to understand your business and what it does, then understand your goals and plans,
and from there we would be able to decide how to best approach your specific case. We believe all companies are unique
and also have unique needs, and therefore the solutions we deliver must be tailored to each company. We think of ourselves
as delivering digital solutions, and there is no way to deliver a solution if we don&amp;rsquo;t discover what problems you are
trying to solve, or what goals you aim to achieve.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Below is a list of the solutions we offer under web and mobile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;websites&#34;&gt;Websites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A website, at its most basic is a web presence for your company, a way for people to be able to find information about
your company on the web. However, we take a different approach, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to build websites just so you can be on
the web, we want to help you push your business goals with your website, whatever the goals may be. Do you
want more customers, then we have to create a website geared towards this. Do you want to sell directly to your
customers on your website, then the website must have your products taking centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intranets&#34;&gt;Intranets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intranet is an internal web app that you will use internally with your teams to communicate, share work, schedule meetings,
share resources etc. Because every company has unique processes and policies, we set out to create an intranet that conforms
to all these needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mobile-apps&#34;&gt;Mobile Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of users now have moved to mobile, mobile phone use in Botswana is very high, and companies need to go where the users are.
While websites are usable on mobile devices, a mobile app has the advantage of being tailored to the medium, and therefore it
delivers a better overall experience. We build apps for any use case, whether its for internal use in a company, or to be used
by customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ussd-apps&#34;&gt;USSD Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSD apps are very useful for companies that have a lot of customers without smartphones, and still need to deliver mobile
experiences. We create USSD apps that fulfill your specific business case, so that none of your customers are left behind. We
would handle API integrations with the major telecoms operators and deliver a USSD app to your specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-client-brief&#34;&gt;The Client Brief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin &amp;amp; Davis had to redesign Giscoe’s website as part of their digital marketing plans, and needed a tech partner to execute on their designs with a 4 weeks turnaround time before launch. The new website was going to be slick, mobile and clearly showcased Giscoe’s services with a clear call to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-approach&#34;&gt;The Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Scrum for Software development, our Senior Engineers and a Project Manager working alongside the client’s Graphic Design and Digital Marketing team, we were able to deliver the project on time without issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stack&#34;&gt;The Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to be able to update the site content on their own, so we used our tried and trusted Django. It was a tough project, due to tight deadlines, and the client being particular about what they wanted, and the fact that the designers also had exacting standards that we had to adhere to. It was fun, being challenged like that and finding out just how much we can offer to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, we were implementing a design that had already been created for us by the design firm Benjamin &amp;amp; Davis, and all we had to do was code it in a CMS and make sure the final site was the same as the provided PSDs. We loved the design, its simplicity, the big and bold typography, and above all else the minimalism. You will notice the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on big images to look good, there is a clever use of typography and color to deliver a great design.

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-initial-idea&#34;&gt;The Initial Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial idea of Lifti came from the fact that there are a lot of cars in the Botswana, and most people work and live in the same places. It could be Commerce Park, or Fairgrounds, or Mogoditshane, or BBS etc, so we thought it should be possible for these people to share cars and travel together. Its a win win in the end, you make friends, help others and sometimes make extra cash. Also, people can travel together using the same platform for longer trips, for example during holidays when we all want to go back to our home villages. We thought it would be nice to have a central place where people could find a list of all the lifts available and they can look for one that suits them and make a lift request and travel together.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a platform where we didnt want to make money, but to simply use technology to connect people and hopefully make the world a better place. There has been a lot of concern recently regarding carbon footprints and global warming, and this is our way of contributing positively towards this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;logo-design&#34;&gt;Logo Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo was commissioned from a local designer. The idea was to have a simple but nice logo, that also has takes some meaning from the idea of Lifti itself. If you notice, the F, the T and the I have a little thing going, in that they could be said to be lifting each other up in a way. The color choices were also important, a grey to represent the idea of the travel industry itself, and the yellow to add a dash of color and playfulness to the whole thing. It worked really well in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;case-study-logo&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/logos/lifti.png&#34; alt=&#34;Lifi Logo&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stack&#34;&gt;The Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifti was built by using NodeJS in the backend, and CSS, HTML5 and Javascript in the front end. We were tempted to use AngularJS in the front end, but we were concerned about taking too long to bring something to market, for an idea that was mostly experimental and wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be monetized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fonts-used&#34;&gt;Fonts Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all our designs, one of the things we try to nail down as soon as possible is the fonts to use. Proper typography makes all the difference in a design. Normally we try to pair a sans-serif font with a serif font, but in this case we found a perfect combination of sans-serif fonts and bent the rules a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;abel&#34;&gt;Abel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the headings, we chose Abel, a nice clean Google Font that works well for headings. It is clean and very legible, and makes the headings really stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;roboto&#34;&gt;Roboto&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the body text, we went with Roboto, which is the main Google font for Android. It is a very clean and legible font, perfect for body text. It also works very well with our choice for the heading text, Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in simplicity, above all else. When a design is simple, it becomes a lot more usable, and can fulfill whatever use we want it to perform. Clutter on the other hand, hides away important functionalities, and confuses users. We wanted the site to be clean and minimal, so we paired mostly greys for the background and dark grey for the text. We made sure to balance it off by adding bright colors to our buttons so they stand out a lot more. We also made sure to use bright colors for notifications, to make sure we really get our users&amp;rsquo; attention when it really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-client-brief&#34;&gt;The Client Brief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nova is a student bursary web app, it connects students with companies that offer bursaries. This is a very important project, because
in South Africa, students are not sponsored by the government, rather they have to either self-sponsor, or get bursaries. A platform that
connects deserving students with companies willing to give out bursaries therefore is very critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stack&#34;&gt;The Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Django for the website, to allow the client to add more content over time. A site like this needs to be kept up to date with new bursaries and new companies for it to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client likes the color green, and also wanted a clean and simple design. We cerainly delivered, and we made sure to keep the site simple and have the content drive the design, not the other way around. The choice of fonts was important, to make sure the content would be clear and legible.

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-client-brief&#34;&gt;The Client Brief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praekelt Consulting had to redesign Telkom’s website and integrate all the microsites they previously had. To effectively achieve the new design, they needed a dedicated Content Curation team to help with Telkom’s vast products and deals on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-approach&#34;&gt;The Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the requirements and the time sensitivity of the project, we deployed a full time team to work with Praekelt Consulting and Telkom’s product managers from the project planning phase till post launch of what is arguably the biggest &amp;amp; best Telecom eCommerce site in Africa. Our Content team remained with the project post launch to facilitate products and deals updates as per marketing and promotions plans of Telkom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, our work was limited to just the content. Telkom has a very complicated CMS, and has lots of products and deals that change quickly&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reo Properties</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/case-study/reo/</link>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-client-brief&#34;&gt;The Client Brief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner of Reo Properties is an old friend, and one day he got in touch because his company had grown and needed a web presence. We agreed wholeheartedly, its important for companies to be on the internet nowadays so they can remain competitive. Reo Properties is a real estate company, they connect landlords with tenants, which is a very big market in Botswana. People are always looking for houses to rent or buy, or they want better houses than the ones they currently occupy, and someone needs to be able to make all these connections.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The site would need to list all their currently available properties, have all the details visible to the user such as the prices, availablity, whether they are for sale or for rent, the location etc etc. The client had a basic idea of the sort of sites they wanted to benchmark on, and what they want their site to have in terms of content and so on. But the task on settling on a design was lef to us, the agreement was we would build what we had in mind, also incorporating ideas from the benchmark websites, then have the client review the site and we would then see whether to revise the design or to carry on with our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;logo-design&#34;&gt;Logo Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo was commissioned from a local designer, the same designer who did the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/case-study/lifti&#34;&gt;Lifti&lt;/a&gt; logo. There had been a previous logo, which we felt had not been done very well, and so we set out to take ideas from the old logo, which the client liked, and to clean it up and make it better. The client likes the idea of a lion, the spirit that the lion represents, and also real estate itself, so the logo had to have these two elements together. They also had gold as their main color, so the logo designer had to use gold in the logo. In the end, it worked very well, and the client was very happy with the new logo, and we loved the results as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;case-study-logo&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/logos/reo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reo Logo&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stack&#34;&gt;The Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to be able to update the site content on their own, and to be able to add new properties as they got more clients, so we needed to set up a CMS for them. We love Django, a Python CMS, and we use that for most of our clients who want a CMS. We then did a short training session for the client after launch so they could update the site on their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the frontend we used the usual suspects, CSS and Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;photography&#34;&gt;Photography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed to use imagery from Botswana, Gaborone to be specific, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t just get stock photos because you would rarely find any photos of our beloved city in any of these sites. So we commissioned photos from a local photography company to take photos of some of the best places in the city for Reo&amp;rsquo;s image bank, and we chose some from here to use on the website. The results were stunning, there were some very nice photos that came out from the shoot, which we used for the main slider on the home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fonts-used&#34;&gt;Fonts Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;source-sans-pro&#34;&gt;Source Sans Pro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to use one font across the site, we had tried some combos and when we finally settled on Source Sans Pro we found it worked perfectly on its own, which to us meant quicker load times for the site, which is also very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client also believes in minimalism as much as we do, and so the choice of design was easy. We used gold for all the main headings, as it is the company&amp;rsquo;s main color, and for the rest of the site played with shades of blue for different sections to give the site balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-client-brief&#34;&gt;The Client Brief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unilever SA needed to recreate their physical staff kiosks online to allow a “click &amp;amp; collect” process for their employees across all their offices from Durban to Johannesburg. The online store needed to address several issues such as stock availability, data privacy &amp;amp; security, payment, product quantity restrictions and integration with their existing SAP &amp;amp; Microsoft systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-approach&#34;&gt;The Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a deeper analysis of the challenges presented by the client, and observing employees using the kiosks live, we set out to create an omnichannel eCommerce platform that does not only allow the convenience of shopping on the go, but seamlessly integrates with the physical kiosks inventory &amp;amp; Point of Sale systems for real time transactions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The reason behind this approach was to ensure that the online store works in the similar way as the kiosks without discrepancies that might render the new platform inconvenient, whilst allowing Unilever’s product marketing team personalise promotions based on cart history and behaviour on the platform using the built in CRM we added to platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>eButler</title>
      <link>http://mmogodigital.com/case-study/ebutler/</link>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-initial-idea&#34;&gt;The Initial Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eButler is an internal project, that is being run by our Joburg office. eButler was our first internal project, and has been our flagship product in South Africa so far. The idea is to do grocery shopping for people, using Uber for last mile delivery.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We have found that the idea was very popular with companies that need someone to restock their office supplies, which led to the birth of eButler for business, which has accounted for most of our sales revenue so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;logo-design&#34;&gt;Logo Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo was done by a South African design firm, we wanted a simple logo that also had a cart graphic, to show our shopping roots. We had a logo before, but we found it did not truly represent the eButler brand that we had in mind. The new logo had an interesting typography, and the cart graphic we picked had a bow-tie element, that ties to the idea of a traditional butler.
&lt;p class=&#39;case-study-logo&#39; markdown=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://mmogodigital.com/img/logos/ebutler.png&#34; alt=&#34;eButler Logo&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fonts-used&#34;&gt;Fonts Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For eButler, we did the classic font pairing, a sans-serif font and a serif font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;montserrat&#34;&gt;Montserrat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the main headings, we picked Montserrat, a beautiful sans-serif font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;istok-web&#34;&gt;Istok Web&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the body text, we settled on Istok Web. It&amp;rsquo;s a stylish and simple font that works well with blocks of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design was supposed to be simple, so that the products would stand out. And the use of color had to be smart, so that product imagery would not be overwhelmed by the design. At the core, eButler is a shopping site, and shopping sites are driven by product imagery, and in a way it is easier to design. We decided that we want users to start purchasing as soon as possible, therefore the obvious thing to do was to have the products on the home page, and we decided these had to be the most popular products that other users are purchasing
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Incidentally, we are working on version 2 of eButler, which is informed by all that we have learnt over the past 2 years running eButler. We love the direction its going in already, and we can&amp;rsquo;t wait to unveil it to the rest of our users.
